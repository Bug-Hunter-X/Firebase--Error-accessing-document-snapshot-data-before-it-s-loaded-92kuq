The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded. This can happen if you use the data from the snapshot in an asynchronous operation before the `onSnapshot` or `get()` promise resolves.  For example:
```javascript
const docRef = doc(db, 'collection', 'docId');

docRef.onSnapshot((doc) => {
  console.log(doc.data().field); // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'field')
});
```
This happens because `doc.data()` might return `undefined` before the data is fully fetched, leading to an error when trying to access `field`.
